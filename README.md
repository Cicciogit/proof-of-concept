# proof-of-concept
As as I decided not to use Nightwatch to write the scenarios in Gherkin, I had to install cucumber by using the Node Package Manager in three steps : 

1 - This the first step is to install  Cucumber.js module that can ce use in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code

npm install  --save-dev cucumber

2 - It will the then necessarry a selenium webdriver in order to automate the interactions with the webpages

 npm install selenium-webdriver
 
3- As the browser should be chromedriver, this is also to be installed 

npm install -g chromedriver


Once this installed
